# hello-world
just another non-important repository
This is Darkgyft, and this is my first step on changing my life.  Back in the '80's, I was into coding, just like anybody else at that time.  I was creating web pages, signature boxes, and learning anythign I could to do something cool on a computer.  Then life got in the way and elbowed these interests aside.  I got a job doing whatever I could, which led to other jobs, based on the experience I obtained from the previous job.  I followed many branches to arrive where I am today.  I'd like to make a career change back to what I loved to do.
